When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When others are working on it, or as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pulling the changes ensures that you're getting the copy you want to work with.
