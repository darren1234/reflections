When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When others are working on it, or as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pulling the changes ensures that you're getting the copy you want to work with.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is used to clone a GitHub repository to another GitHub account.  A clone is a local copy of another repository (local or from GitHub.)  A branch is a segment of a repository/project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

For comparison.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Copying and transferring code, and lots of communication.  A better understanding of the project based on the information would be an advantage but a big project with multiple parts would be difficult to manage.
