What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It sets up the folder to be accessable by git hub.  You need it initialized to be able to commit version data to the hub.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory and the repository.  It's a virtual area that lists the working directory files to be committed to the repository.

The value of the staging area is that it allows us to prepare and group multiple files (in the same state) to be committed at one time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

It's easy to prepare a commit by making the needed changes (across multiple files if needed) and then committing the total logical change at once.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches could be helpful if making a potential change that you're unsure of until tested.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It allows us to see the growth of the project.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches allows different modifications of code to be grouped into one project.  We represent the diagram the way we do to show the iterative process built in each branch.
