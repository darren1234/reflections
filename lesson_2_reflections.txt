What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It sets up the folder to be accessable by git hub.  You need it initialized to be able to commit version data to the hub.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory and the repository.  It's a virtual area that lists the working directory files to be committed to the repository.

The value of the staging area is that it allows us to prepare and group multiple files (in the same state) to be committed at one time.
